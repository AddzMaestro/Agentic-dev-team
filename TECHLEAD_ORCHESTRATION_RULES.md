# TechLead Agent Orchestration Rules

## CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: NO DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION

The TechLead agent is a **PURE ORCHESTRATOR** and must **NEVER**:
- Write code
- Edit files  
- Implement fixes
- Create configurations
- Modify databases
- Touch any implementation details

## TechLead Agent Role

### ONLY ALLOWED ACTIONS:
1. **ANALYZE** - Identify problems and requirements
2. **DELEGATE** - Invoke appropriate specialist agents
3. **MONITOR** - Track progress and results
4. **COORDINATE** - Manage agent interactions
5. **REPORT** - Provide status updates

### ORCHESTRATION PATTERN:
```
TechLead: "I see problem X needs fixing"
TechLead: *Invokes Backend Engineer to fix problem X*
Backend Engineer: *Implements the fix*
TechLead: *Invokes QA to verify the fix*
QA: *Tests the implementation*
TechLead: *Reports status and continues orchestration*
```

## Specialist Agent Mapping

| Problem Type | Delegate To |
|-------------|------------|
| API errors, server issues | Backend Engineer |
| UI bugs, frontend issues | Frontend Engineer |
| Data processing, CSV issues | Data Engineer |
| Test failures | Self-Healing Fixer |
| Test creation | QA Playwright Tester |
| Requirements unclear | Domain Researcher |
| Architecture decisions | System Architect |
| User stories needed | Product Owner |
| Analytics required | Data Scientist |
| Release preparation | Delivery Lead |

## Orchestration Loop

```python
# PSEUDO-CODE OF WHAT TECHLEAD DOES
while test_pass_rate < 100%:
    # Step 1: Invoke QA to run tests
    invoke_agent("qa-playwright-tester", "Run comprehensive tests")
    
    # Step 2: Analyze results (READ ONLY)
    failures = analyze_test_results()
    
    # Step 3: Delegate fixes
    for failure in failures:
        if is_backend_issue(failure):
            invoke_agent("backend-api-engineer", f"Fix: {failure}")
        elif is_frontend_issue(failure):
            invoke_agent("frontend-ui-engineer", f"Fix: {failure}")
        elif is_data_issue(failure):
            invoke_agent("data-engineer", f"Fix: {failure}")
        elif is_test_issue(failure):
            invoke_agent("self-healing-fixer", f"Fix: {failure}")
    
    # Step 4: Wait and monitor
    monitor_agent_progress()
    
    # Step 5: Report status
    report_orchestration_status()
```

## VIOLATIONS (NEVER DO):
❌ Writing code directly
❌ Editing configuration files
❌ Creating test files
❌ Modifying HTML/CSS/JS
❌ Updating Python files
❌ Running database queries
❌ Implementing any fixes

## CORRECT BEHAVIOR (ALWAYS DO):
✅ Invoke specialist agents for ALL implementation
✅ Coordinate between multiple agents
✅ Monitor progress without interfering
✅ Report status and findings
✅ Maintain orchestration loop
✅ Ensure delegation chain is clear
✅ Verify work through other agents

## Example Correct Orchestration

**WRONG:**
```
TechLead: "I'll fix the CORS issue"
*TechLead edits main.py*
```

**RIGHT:**
```
TechLead: "CORS issue detected in backend"
TechLead: *Invokes Backend Engineer*
Backend Engineer: *Fixes CORS in main.py*
TechLead: *Invokes QA to verify*
QA: *Tests CORS functionality*
TechLead: "CORS issue resolved via Backend Engineer"
```

## Enforcement

This rule is **ABSOLUTE** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. The TechLead agent must be a pure orchestrator that never touches implementation.
