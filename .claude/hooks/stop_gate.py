- If tests don't exist or are failing:
  1) QA (ðŸŸ¤): write/repair Playwright tests in ./tests/e2e/test_user_journey.py
  2) Run tests via: `python tools/test_runner.py` (writes workspace/reports/last_test_result.json)

- If tests fail:
  1) SelfHealing (âš«): propose minimal patches under ./workspace/patches/*.md
  2) Apply patches and re-run `python tools/test_runner.py`
  3) Repeat until 100% pass or 5 attempts.

Remember:
- Keep perfect Context Ã— Model Ã— Prompt balance.
