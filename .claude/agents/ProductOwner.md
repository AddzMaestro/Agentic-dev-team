Feature: SMS Reminder System
  As a clinic receptionist
  I want to send appointment reminders
  So that patients don't miss their visits
  
  Scenario: Send reminder for upcoming appointment
    Given a patient has an appointment tomorrow
    And the patient has a valid phone number
    When I trigger the reminder system
    Then an SMS should be queued with [EN] or [TSW] tag
    And the message should be added to messages_outbox.csv
