# AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATION DIRECTIVE

## Mission Statement
Achieve 100% test pass rate for ClinicLite Botswana system through continuous autonomous orchestration of specialist agents with comprehensive edge case coverage.

## Orchestration Framework

### Core Loop Algorithm
```
WHILE (test_pass_rate < 100% OR uncovered_edge_cases > 0):
    1. QA_Agent.run_comprehensive_tests()
    2. analyze_failures()
    3. delegate_fixes_to_specialists()
    4. verify_fixes()
    5. update_metrics()
    6. generate_progress_report()
```

### Agent Delegation Matrix

| Issue Category | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Validation Agent |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| API Errors | Backend Engineer | Data Engineer | QA Playwright |
| UI Bugs | Frontend Engineer | - | QA Playwright |
| Data Processing | Data Engineer | Backend Engineer | QA Playwright |
| Test Failures | Self-Healing Fixer | QA Playwright | - |
| Requirements | Product Owner | Domain Researcher | - |
| Architecture | System Architect | Backend Engineer | - |
| Performance | Backend Engineer | Frontend Engineer | QA Playwright |

### Edge Case Test Coverage

#### Data Validation Cases
- [ ] Empty CSV files (0 bytes)
- [ ] Malformed CSV (missing columns, wrong delimiter)
- [ ] Duplicate entries (same ID, different data)
- [ ] Special characters (UTF-8, emojis, RTL text)
- [ ] Extreme values (dates: 1900-2100, numbers: -âˆž to +âˆž)
- [ ] Null/undefined/empty string combinations
- [ ] Mixed data types in columns
- [ ] CSV injection attempts

#### User Interaction Cases
- [ ] Rapid clicking (< 100ms intervals)
- [ ] Multiple concurrent uploads
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Multiple tabs/windows
- [ ] Drag and drop files
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility

#### Network & Performance Cases
- [ ] Offline mode transitions
- [ ] Network interruptions (mid-upload)
- [ ] Slow connections (< 1Mbps)
- [ ] Large file uploads (> 10MB)
- [ ] Concurrent user sessions
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Request timeouts
- [ ] Connection drops

#### Security Cases
- [ ] SQL injection in all inputs
- [ ] XSS attempts in forms
- [ ] CSRF token validation
- [ ] Path traversal attempts
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Authorization escalation
- [ ] File upload exploits
- [ ] Header injection

#### Boundary Cases
- [ ] Maximum field lengths
- [ ] Minimum valid inputs
- [ ] Zero/negative values
- [ ] Floating point precision
- [ ] Date/time edge cases
- [ ] Phone number formats (international)
- [ ] Language toggle edge cases
