# ULTRA-THINK Framework

> Deep thinking protocol for complex decision-making and problem-solving

## Overview

ULTRA-THINK is a structured approach to ensure thorough analysis before implementation. Use this framework for:
- Major architectural decisions
- Complex problem solving
- Risk assessment
- Implementation planning
- Debugging difficult issues

## The ULTRA-THINK Process

### U - Unknowns
*Identify what we don't know*

#### Questions to Ask:
- What information is missing?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What are the hidden dependencies?
- What edge cases haven't been considered?
- What could surprise us later?

#### Documentation Format:
```markdown
## Unknowns
1. **[Unknown Category]**: [Description]
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Investigation needed: [Yes/No]
   - Blocking: [Yes/No]
```

### L - Landscape
*Map the solution space*

#### Areas to Explore:
- Existing solutions and patterns
- Available tools and libraries
- Technical constraints
- Business requirements
- Timeline and resources

#### Documentation Format:
```markdown
## Landscape Analysis
- **Current State**: [Description]
- **Desired State**: [Description]
- **Gap Analysis**: [What needs to change]
- **Available Resources**: [List]
- **Constraints**: [List]
```

### T - Trade-offs
*Evaluate options and their implications*

#### Consideration Matrix:
| Option | Pros | Cons | Risk | Effort | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|------|--------|----------------|
| A | | | L/M/H | S/M/L | Yes/No |
| B | | | L/M/H | S/M/L | Yes/No |

#### Key Trade-offs to Consider:
- Performance vs. Complexity
- Speed vs. Quality
- Flexibility vs. Simplicity
- Cost vs. Features
- Short-term vs. Long-term

### R - Risks
*Anticipate what could go wrong*

#### Risk Assessment:
```markdown
## Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|--------|
| [Risk Description] | L/M/H | L/M/H | [Strategy] | [Agent] | [Status] |
```

#### Pre-mortem Questions:
- What could cause this to fail?
- What are the worst-case scenarios?
- What dependencies could break?
- What assumptions could be wrong?
- How would we recover from failure?

### A - Approach
*Define the implementation strategy*

#### Micro-plan Structure:
```markdown
## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. [ ] Task 1 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)
2. [ ] Task 2 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. [ ] Task 3 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)
2. [ ] Task 4 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. [ ] Task 5 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)
2. [ ] Task 6 (Owner: Agent, Duration: Xh)

### Dependencies:
- Task 2 depends on Task 1
- Task 4 can run parallel with Task 3

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete
```

## When to Use ULTRA-THINK

### Mandatory Triggers:
