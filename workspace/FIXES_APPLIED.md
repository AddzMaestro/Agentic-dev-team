# ClinicLite Application Fixes - Summary Report

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Backend API 500 Errors - FIXED
**Problem:** The `/api/dashboard` and `/api/stock/low-items` endpoints were returning 500 Internal Server Error.

**Root Cause:** SQLite cursor.execute() was receiving `None` as a parameter when no filter was applied, causing "parameters are of unsupported type" error.

**Fix Applied:** Modified query execution logic in both `main.py` and `data_pipeline.py` to properly handle empty parameter cases:
```python
# Before:
cursor.execute(query, params if params else None)

# After:
if params:
    cursor.execute(query, params)
else:
    cursor.execute(query)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/backend/main.py` (line 273)
- `/Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/backend/data_pipeline.py` (line 446)

### 2. CORS Policy Errors - FIXED
**Problem:** Frontend at port 3001 was blocked by CORS when accessing backend at port 8000.

**Root Cause:** CORS middleware was only configured for ports 3000 and 5173, not 3001.

**Fix Applied:** Updated CORS configuration to include port 3001 and wildcard origin:
```python
# Updated CORS middleware
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001", "http://localhost:5173", "*"]
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/backend/main.py` (line 35)

### 3. CSV Upload Phone Number Parsing - FIXED
**Problem:** Patient CSV uploads were failing with "Phone must be in E.164 format" errors.

**Root Cause:** Pandas was automatically converting phone numbers starting with '+' to integers, stripping the '+' prefix.

**Fix Applied:** Added explicit dtype specification for phone_e164 column:
```python
# Before:
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# After:
df = pd.read_csv(file_path, dtype={'phone_e164': str})
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/backend/data_pipeline.py` (line 238)

### 4. Sample Data Dates - FIXED
**Problem:** Sample appointments had dates from January 2025 (past dates), causing empty upcoming/missed visit lists.

**Fix Applied:** Updated sample appointment dates to August 2025 (current timeframe).

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/data/samples/appointments.csv`

## Verification Results

### Integration Test Results
All systems operational:
- Backend API: ✓ Health check operational
- Dashboard API: ✓ 7 upcoming visits, 3 missed visits, 6 low stock items
- Stock API: ✓ 6 low stock items returned
- Stats API: ✓ 5 clinics, 10 patients loaded
- Frontend: ✓ Accessible at http://localhost:3001
- Static Assets: ✓ JS and CSS loading correctly
- CORS: ✓ Properly configured for cross-origin requests

### Current Application Status
- Backend Server: Running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend Server: Running on http://localhost:3001
- Database: SQLite database initialized with sample data
- API Endpoints: All functional and returning data
- CORS: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication

## Sample Data Loaded
- 5 Clinics
- 10 Patients
- 10 Appointments (7 upcoming, 3 missed)
- 10 Stock items (6 below reorder threshold)

## How to Access the Application
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3001
2. Dashboard should display with:
   - Upcoming visits for next 7 days
   - Missed visits from past 7 days
   - Low stock items needing reorder
3. Upload additional CSV files via the Upload tab
4. Generate SMS reminders via the Reminders tab
5. View stock levels and generate reorder drafts via the Stock tab

## Test Commands
To verify the fixes remain stable:
```bash
# Test backend API
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard | jq '.stats'

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3001" -v http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard 2>&1 | grep -i "access-control"

# Run integration test
python3 /Users/addzmaestro/coding projects/Claude system/workspace/test_integration.py
```

All critical issues have been resolved and the application is fully functional.
