## Detailed Feature Analysis

### ✅ Fully Implemented Features

1. **Risk Score Calculation**
   - Endpoint: `/api/predictions/calculate`
   - Returns: risk_score (0-100), confidence, factors, recommendation
   - Factors: distance, history, weather, demographics
   - Response time: ~300ms (needs optimization)

2. **SMS Reminder System**
   - Language support: English (EN) and Tswana (TSW)
   - Risk-based timing adjustments
   - Bulk message generation
   - Integration with appointment system

3. **Model Management**
   - Training endpoint functional
   - Version tracking with semantic versioning
   - Model comparison capabilities

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features

1. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - HTML pages exist but React components not fully mounting
   - Missing UI elements: #pattern-analysis, #risk-summary, #sms-queue
   - Basic risk display working but advanced features missing

2. **Waitlist Management**
   - Priority scoring logic works
   - Add operation has validation issues (422 error)
   - UI page exists but not fully functional

3. **Offline Mode**
   - Action queuing works
   - Local storage persistence functional
   - Visual indicators missing

### ❌ Missing Features

1. **Smart Scheduling API** (`/api/scheduling/smart`)
   - Endpoint returns 404
   - Overbooking calculations work independently
   - Integration with main scheduling not complete

2. **Pattern Analysis Display**
   - Backend likely has data
   - Frontend visualization not implemented

3. **Accessibility Features**
   - ARIA labels missing
   - Screen reader support incomplete
   - Keyboard navigation not tested

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Risk Calculation | < 100ms | 313ms | ❌ FAIL |
| Batch Processing | < 20ms/patient | 15ms | ✅ PASS |
| Dashboard Load | < 2 seconds | N/A | ❌ FAIL (page doesn't load) |
| API Response | < 500ms | ~300ms | ✅ PASS |

## Missing Implementation Details

Based on NO_SHOW_SPEC.md requirements not yet implemented:

1. **Risk Factor Weights** - Should sum to 1.0 (not validated in current API)
2. **Temporal Ordering** - calculated_at timestamps not verified
3. **Buffer Slots** - 15-minute buffers every 2 hours not enforced
4. **Intervention Tracking** - Idempotency not guaranteed
5. **Historical Limits** - 90-day history retention not verified
6. **Notification Windows** - 4-hour response window for waitlist not enforced

## Recommendations for Fixes

### Priority 1 - Critical Issues
1. **Fix Frontend Loading**: Ensure React components mount properly
2. **Implement Smart Scheduling API**: Create `/api/scheduling/smart` endpoint
3. **Optimize Risk Calculation**: Reduce from 313ms to <100ms

### Priority 2 - Important Features
4. **Complete Waitlist API**: Fix validation issues in `/api/waitlist/add`
5. **Add Offline Indicators**: Implement `.offline-indicator` CSS class
6. **Pattern Analysis UI**: Create visualization for pattern data

### Priority 3 - Accessibility & Polish
7. **Add ARIA Labels**: Implement for all interactive elements
8. **Fix Page Titles**: Ensure all pages have proper titles
9. **Add H1 Headers**: One per page for screen readers

## Screenshots Captured

- ✅ Successfully captured prediction dashboard state
- ✅ Waitlist page loading attempts documented
- ✅ SMS monitor interface state saved
- ✅ Offline mode test results captured

## Test Execution Details

- **Test Framework:** Playwright with pytest
- **Browser:** Chromium
- **Test Duration:** 75.16 seconds
- **Test Report:** XML format saved to `workspace/reports/no_show_test_results.xml`

## Conclusion

The No-Show Prediction System has successfully implemented the core prediction engine with accurate risk scoring and SMS integration. However, significant work remains on the frontend UI, smart scheduling features, and accessibility compliance. The system meets 58.6% of the tested requirements, with critical gaps in user-facing features that need immediate attention.

### Next Steps
1. Fix React component mounting issues
2. Implement missing API endpoints
3. Complete frontend UI elements
4. Optimize performance to meet targets
5. Add comprehensive accessibility support
