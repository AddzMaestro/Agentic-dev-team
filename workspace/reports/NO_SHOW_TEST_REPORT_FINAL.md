8. ✅ Integration with SMS system - Queues bulk reminders for high-risk patients
9. ✅ Model training endpoint - Training API works
10. ✅ Model versioning - Version management system functional

### Frontend Tests (7/7 Working)
1. ✅ Risk score display - Shows risk indicators with proper color coding
2. ✅ Offline action queuing - Queues actions when offline
3. ✅ Local storage persistence - Data persists in browser storage
4. ✅ Batch processing performance - Processes 100 patients efficiently
5. ✅ Missing patient data handling - Handles 404 errors gracefully
6. ✅ Invalid risk factor handling - Validates and caps invalid values
7. ✅ Model comparison - Compares model performance

## Tests That Are STILL FAILING ❌

### Critical Frontend Issues (7 failures)
1. ❌ **Prediction dashboard loads** - Page returns empty HTML, no title
2. ❌ **Pattern analysis display** - #pattern-analysis element not found
3. ❌ **Waitlist management page** - Page returns empty HTML
4. ❌ **SMS monitor page** - #sms-queue element not visible
5. ❌ **Offline mode detection** - .offline-indicator not showing
6. ❌ **ARIA labels present** - Accessibility labels missing
7. ❌ **Screen reader compatibility** - No H1 elements found

### Backend Performance Issues (2 failures)
1. ❌ **Risk calculation performance** - Takes 311ms (requirement: <100ms)
2. ❌ **Dashboard load performance** - #risk-summary element not visible

### API Issues (2 failures)
1. ❌ **Smart scheduling API** - Returns 405 Method Not Allowed (needs GET instead of POST)
2. ❌ **Waitlist operations** - Returns 422 Unprocessable Entity

### Test Infrastructure Issue (1 failure)
1. ❌ **Concurrent request handling** - AsyncIO runtime error in test

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Frontend Pages Not Loading
The HTML pages (prediction.html, waitlist-management.html, sms-monitor.html) are returning empty content. This suggests:
- Static files are not being served correctly
- HTML files may not exist in the static directory
- Routing configuration issue in FastAPI

### Problem 2: API Method Mismatches
- Smart scheduling endpoint expects GET but test uses POST
- Waitlist add endpoint has validation issues with the request data

### Problem 3: Performance Regression
- Risk calculation taking 3x longer than requirement (311ms vs 100ms target)
- Possible database query optimization needed

## Specific Issues to Fix

1. **Static File Serving**:
   - Verify /static/ directory contains HTML files
   - Check FastAPI static file mounting configuration
   - Ensure prediction.html, waitlist-management.html, sms-monitor.html exist

2. **API Corrections**:
   - Change smart scheduling from POST to GET
   - Fix waitlist validation schema

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile risk calculation endpoint
   - Add caching for repeated calculations
   - Optimize database queries

## Test Coverage by Feature

| Feature | Tests | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Risk Calculation | 5 | 3 | 2 | 60% |
| Dashboard UI | 6 | 1 | 5 | 17% |
| Smart Scheduling | 2 | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Waitlist Management | 3 | 1 | 2 | 33% |
| SMS System | 3 | 3 | 0 | 100% |
| Offline Mode | 3 | 2 | 1 | 67% |
| Integration | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| Performance | 3 | 1 | 2 | 33% |
| Accessibility | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0% |

## Comparison with TYPE Specification

### Implemented and Working ✅
- Risk score calculation with proper factors
- Risk category thresholds (Low/Medium/High/VeryHigh)
- SMS language support (EN/TSW)
- Model training and versioning
- Patient data validation
- Batch processing

### Not Fully Implemented ❌
- Frontend dashboards (HTML pages not loading)
- Smart scheduling recommendations
- Waitlist queue management UI
- Offline mode indicators
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels)
- Performance requirements not met

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Static File Serving** - Ensure HTML files exist and are properly served
2. **Create Missing HTML Pages** - prediction.html, waitlist-management.html, sms-monitor.html
3. **Fix API Methods** - Correct HTTP methods for smart scheduling
4. **Optimize Performance** - Cache risk calculations, optimize queries

### To Achieve 100% Pass Rate:
1. Implement all frontend pages with proper structure
2. Add ARIA labels for accessibility
3. Optimize risk calculation to meet <100ms requirement
4. Fix waitlist API validation
5. Add offline mode indicators
6. Ensure all HTML pages have proper titles

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: The backend APIs are mostly working (10/12 API tests passing), but the frontend is completely broken (only 1/7 UI tests passing). The fixes that were reported as implemented are NOT actually working in the frontend.

**Pass Rate**: 58.6% - NO IMPROVEMENT from previous run

**Critical Issue**: The main problem is that the frontend HTML pages are not being served correctly, causing most UI tests to fail.

**Next Steps**: Focus on fixing static file serving and creating the missing HTML pages before attempting to achieve 100% pass rate.
