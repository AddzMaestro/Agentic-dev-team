## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make startup script executable
chmod +x workspace/start.sh

# Run the application
cd workspace
./start.sh

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build container
docker build -t cliniclite .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 cliniclite
```

## Testing Instructions

### Run Playwright Tests
```bash
# Install Playwright
npx playwright@1.38.0 install chromium

# Run tests
pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/e2e/test_csv_upload.py -v
```

## Next Steps & Recommendations
