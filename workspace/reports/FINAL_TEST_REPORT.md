## Critical Issues Remaining

### 🔴 HIGH Priority (Blocking 100% Pass)
1. **Large File Performance**
   - Current: Timeout at 1500 rows
   - Solution: Implement streaming/chunking
   - Impact: Users cannot upload large datasets

2. **Security Validation**
   - Current: XSS/SQL tests failing
   - Solution: Enhanced input sanitization
   - Impact: Potential vulnerabilities

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority
1. **Date Range Validation**
   - Current: Some valid dates rejected
   - Solution: Flexible date parsing
   - Impact: Historical data entry blocked

2. **Phone Format Support**
   - Current: Limited format acceptance
   - Solution: Regex improvements
   - Impact: Valid numbers rejected

## Recommendations for 100% Pass Rate

### Immediate Actions (4-6 hours)
1. **Optimize CSV Processing**
   ```python
   # Implement async chunking
   async def process_csv_chunks(file, chunk_size=100):
       async for chunk in read_chunks(file, chunk_size):
           await process_chunk(chunk)
           yield progress_update()
   ```

2. **Enhanced Security Layer**
   ```python
   # Add middleware for input sanitization
   @app.middleware("http")
   async def sanitize_inputs(request, call_next):
       # Sanitize all incoming data
       return await call_next(sanitized_request)
   ```

3. **Improve Date Handling**
   ```python
   # Use dateutil for flexible parsing
   from dateutil import parser
   def parse_date_flexible(date_str):
       return parser.parse(date_str, fuzzy=True)
   ```

### Next Sprint Actions
1. Add request rate limiting
2. Implement caching layer
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Create performance benchmarks
5. Set up continuous testing
